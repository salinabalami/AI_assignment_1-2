_**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**_

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer sciences that emphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working like humans. AI  is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. For example, speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning.

_**Major Fields of Artificial Intelligence**_

**1. Speech recognition:** 
- Speech synthesis, including online and offline speech synthesis
- Speech recognition, including speech dictation and other aspects
- Semantic understanding is to use neural networks to extract the meaning of speech, including voice evaluation and some features of some of our commonly used machine translation.

**2. Computer Vision**
- Object recognition and detection:The computer can quickly detect what we commonly see from the photos. For example, if we take out a landscape photo of a tourist area, we can immediately identify plants, people, animals, or vehicles on it, so does the computer.
- Object Movement Tracking:We have captured an image of an object on a certain frame. In the subsequent videos, we can continuously track the changes and conditions of this object. It is not an easy task. It is difficult to accurately identify an object because it will be subject to sunlight and light in the constant changes.

**3. Natural language processing**
- Computer translation: It mainly includes machine simultaneous translation.
- Information Retrieval: For example, when I tell the computer what I am looking for, then it can search related things for me.
- Intelligent customer service: We interact with the computer through voice and let it answer our questions.
