# AI_Introduction

_**Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**_

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the branch of computer sciences that emphasizes the development of intelligence machines, thinking and working like humans. AI  is frequently applied to the project of developing systems endowed with the intellectual processes characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience. For example, speech recognition, problem-solving, learning and planning.

_**Major Fields of Artificial Intelligence**_

**1. Speech recognition:** 
- Speech synthesis, including online and offline speech synthesis
- Speech recognition, including speech dictation and other aspects
- Semantic understanding is to use neural networks to extract the meaning of speech, including voice evaluation and some features of some of our commonly used machine translation.

**2. Computer Vision**
- Object recognition and detection:The computer can quickly detect what we commonly see from the photos. For example, if we take out a landscape photo of a tourist area, we can immediately identify plants, people, animals, or vehicles on it, so does the computer.
- Object Movement Tracking:We have captured an image of an object on a certain frame. In the subsequent videos, we can continuously track the changes and conditions of this object. It is not an easy task. It is difficult to accurately identify an object because it will be subject to sunlight and light in the constant changes.

**3. Natural language processing**
- Computer translation: It mainly includes machine simultaneous translation.
- Information Retrieval: For example, when I tell the computer what I am looking for, then it can search related things for me.
- Intelligent customer service: We interact with the computer through voice and let it answer our questions.

# Machine Learning

_**Introduction to Machine Learning**_
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.

_**Stages of Machine learning**_

**1. Supervised Learning**
Supervised learning is the types of machine learning in which machines are trained using well "labelled" training data, and on basis of that data, machines predict the output. The labelled data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output. In supervised learning, the training data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher.

**Advantages of Supervised learning:**
- With the help of supervised learning, the model can predict the output on the basis of prior experiences.
- In supervised learning, we can have an exact idea about the classes of objects.
- Supervised learning model helps us to solve various real-world problems such as fraud detection, spam filtering, etc.

**Disadvantages of supervised learning:**
- Supervised learning models are not suitable for handling the complex tasks.
- Supervised learning cannot predict the correct output if the test data is different from the training dataset.
- Training required lots of computation times.
- In supervised learning, we need enough knowledge about the classes of object.

**2. Unsupervised Learing**
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which models are trained using unlabeled dataset and are allowed to act on that data without any supervision.

**Advantages of Unsupervised Learning**
- Unsupervised learning is used for more complex tasks as compared to supervised learning because, in unsupervised learning, we don't have labeled input data.
- Unsupervised learning is preferable as it is easy to get unlabeled data in comparison to labeled data.

**Disadvantages of Unsupervised Learning**
- Unsupervised learning is intrinsically more difficult than supervised learning as it does not have corresponding output.
- The result of the unsupervised learning algorithm might be less accurate as input data is not labeled, and algorithms do not know the exact output in advance.
